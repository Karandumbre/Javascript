Execution Context:

    Everything in javascript happens insdie the execution context.
    Its like a box in which whole javascripot is executed

    It has two components in it
    1. Memory component (Known as variable environment)
        * All the variables and functions are stored in form of key value pair

    2. Code component (Known as Thread of Execution)
        * Where code is executed line by line


Javascript Single Threaded and Syncronous Language 
It can execute one command at a time and in a specific order


* What happens when you run javascript code ?
-> Global Execution context is created
    * Execution Context is created in two phases
        a. Memory Creation Phase
            
        b. Code Execution Phase

* Shortest Program in Javascript:
      Empty JS file (i.e no program)
      
* What is window Object ?

    It is Object which created by javascript along with the global execution context
    All javascript engines responsibilities is to create this global object
    As google chrome and web browsers it is known as "window" object, in case of node it is known as global object
    
    Whenever you create a function or variable which is not inside any function, it is in the GLobal Space
    
    example: index.js
    
    var a = 100;
    
    function b() {
        var x = 10;
    }
    
    console.log(window.a)
    console.log(a)
    console.log(x)

    
    and whenever you create a variable or function inside global space it gets attached to the global object ("Window")
    
    So in above code, when you will se 100 as output instead you are only using console.log(a).
    Javascript assume that you want to access something from global space and it will print.
    
    But when you try to access something which is not in global space you will get an error
    
 * Javascript is a looosely typed language means it does not attaches any specific type to a variable
 
    For example if any variable it contains string, you can assign number or object in later stages
    
    
 Undefined: 
 
    Its just a placeholder. I means in the whole it was not assigned anything so the value is undefined
    
 
* The Scope Chain, Lexical Environment

    Understand with an example
    
    1. function b() {
        console.log(a);
    }
    
    var a = 20;
    
    b();
    
    
    In the above example, Javascript will try to find "a" in the local scope, i.e in the function b();
    As it is not present in local scope it will then go to the parent scope to find "a" (which in this scope is the global scope)
    And it will print 20


     
   2. function b() {
    var a = 20;
    c();
       function c(){
        console.log(a);
       }
    }
    
    
    b();
    
    In the above scenorio, it will be able to aceess 'a' as it is in the parent scope of function "c"
    
    3. function b() {
       var a = 20;

       c();
       function c(){
       }
    }
    
    
    b();
    console.log(a);
    
    In the above program, it will give error as it is not present in the global space
    
    
    *** Scope: Is where you access a variable or a function inside the code *** 
    
 *Lexical Environment
    
    Whenever Execution context is created a lexical envrionemnt is also created. Lexical envrionemnt is the local memory along with lexical environment of its parent
    
    Lexcial means in hierarchy or in sequence
    
    
    function b() {
       var a = 20;

       c();
       function c(){
       }
    }
    
    so in above example, i can say that "c" is sitting lexcically inside "b" function


** Let And Const Variable ** 

1. Let and Const variable are hoisted but very different way then var as they are in temporal dead zone for time being

a ->  when you declare a variable using let or const keyword, value of undefined is attached to it and unlike "var" keyword declaration they are stored in different memory space than global
b. -> Temporal Dead Zone -> is the time when variable is hoisted till a value is assigned to it
If a variable is inside temporal dead zone, you cannot access it until a value is initialised to the variable


Difference between Type Error, Syntax Error and Reference Error

Type Error: example const a = 10;

    a = 100;
    
    It will give error as "a" was of type const and cannot be assigned a value
    
 Syntax Error:
 
     Let b = 100;

     Let b = 1;

     the above code will give syntax error, as let variable is declared and again declared a variable with same name
     
     example 2 :
     
     const b; -> this will give syntax error as const variable need to be initialised
     
  Reference Error:
  
    When javascript want to access something which is not present or is not accessible to the function that time we get reference error
    
  
  Block : Whatever is inside {} (curly braces) is a block
           Block is also known as a compound statement
           Used to combine multiple javascript statements in one group
           These groups can be used where javascript expects only one statement
           
           For eg:
           
           if(true) true <- where true is the single statement
           
           if(true) {
           
            let a = 100
            console.log(a)
            
            }
            
Shadowing:
    var a = 10;
    {
        var a = 100;
        console.loG(100); // gives 100
    }
  
    console.log(a) // give 100 ----> this is known as shadowing. They will print same as they both are in same scope
    
    Declaring same name variable in different scope is known as shadowing
